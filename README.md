CustomAlertView
===============

CustomAlertView is designed to quickly integrate customly designed alert views or other modal views into your iOS app.

You can easily initialize a CustomAlertView by specifying a main image, button frames and completion block which will be called after a user action. It lets you add dynamic content to the alert view and alter behavior with configuration parameters.
