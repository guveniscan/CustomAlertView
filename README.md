CustomAlertView
===============

CustomAlertView is designed to quickly integrate customly designed alert views or other modal views into your iOS app.

You can easily initialize a CustomAlertView by specifying a main image, button frames and a completion block which will be called after a user action. It lets you add dynamic content to the alert view if data or views on alert view should be determined at runtime. Several configuration parameters and abstracted methods are also provided.
